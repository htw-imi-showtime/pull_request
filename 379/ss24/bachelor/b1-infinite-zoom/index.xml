      <description>Process The first step into our project was deciding on a game engine to create it with. After evaluating various options, we chose Godot, an open-source software that supports both its own programming language, GDScript, and C#. Our team used both languages.&#xA;Once the technical decisions were made, we all worked in parallel. Some of us started by focusing on developing the mechanics for a zoom effect in a 3D environment, while others concentrated on implementing smooth player motion.</description>

      <description>Features Zoom Effect We have used different implementations to visualize this effect. In some scenes, the objects are scaled up while the camera stays static; in others, the camera moves forward as the objects keep in their position.&#xA;Transitions When one scene is finished, the game transforms you into a new one, creating an endless loop.&#xA;Gameplay In this game, the player starts with three lives. Colliding with an obstacle decreases half a heart from their health.</description>
